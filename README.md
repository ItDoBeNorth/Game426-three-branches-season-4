# Days at Three Branches(Living Village) agent

Edit `agent.py` to give every one of your villagers a routine. The platform runs a separate `Agent` instance for each NPC, so instances do not share variables or memory. The supplied `sandbox/` directory contains the local runner, types, and village helpers. Leave it unchanged, and leave `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` alone: the pinned packages match the server.

Start with the [Getting Started guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/getting-started/). Then run these commands from this folder:

```console
python -m sandbox watch  # watch your villagers and the scripted visitor
python -m sandbox test   # run the checks
python -m sandbox eval   # run repeatable automated days
```

## Files you will use

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent.py` | Your `Agent` implementation and starter TODOs. |
| `environment.md` | Rules, helpers, observations, and local commands. |
| `manifest.json` | Tells Game Sandbox where the agent class lives. |
| `season.json` | Optional local season settings downloaded from My Submissions. |
| `tests/` | Checks your submission should pass. |
| `sandbox/` | Local game, helpers, and types. Do not edit it. |
| `requirements.txt` | Exact Python package versions used by the server. |
| `requirements-dev.txt` | Test dependencies. |
| `.env.example` | Example local LLM settings. |

The starter shows `action.walk`, `action.stand`, an emote, and `use`. Read [`environment.md`](environment.md) before changing it. Begin with one behavior that you can recognize in `watch`, then make it more responsive to the people and props it sees.

Chat is optional. If you add `chat(self, inbox)` to your agent, send and receive raw message dictionaries that use canonical player IDs such as `"player_0"` and `"player_1"`. For example, return `[{"to": "player_0", "text": "Hello."}]` to send a direct message. The village helpers do not include a chat namespace. Read [`environment.md`](environment.md#chat-with-other-agents) for the inbox format, broadcasts, and delivery timing.

In `watch` and `eval`, your `Agent` controls the whole cast, and `scripted_visitor` controls the visitor. The `naive` built-in is the simple baseline for the cast. When you are ready to submit, follow the [submitting guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/submitting/).

## Optional LLM API

If your instructor enables model calls, follow [Using the LLM API](llm.md). Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add the endpoint and key, and never commit either secret.

Test the connection with:

```console
python -m sandbox llm
```

## Reflection
Season 4: With Day and Night now available, I was able to make tasks and behaviours that used to be by tick now be by time. With a day cycle in place, I also added more time-of-day-specific actions and rules for each role. For example, the lighters now stay up at night and light up the place, and wake other villagers up at dawn. Villagers not only have tasks, but also a plan for gatherings, socialising, and reacting to the visitor based on the time of day and their role; most roles have this so they work and socialise with their roles, work more, gather with everyone at the inn, and then greet their family and sleep. Chat is also now time-aware. Villagers that get startled now introduce the players to others as 'a scary person'.

## AI Use Disclosure and Reflection
I used Claude Code in VS Code. It coded all of this based on my pseudocode and instructions. I verified sets of code it wrote before approving it, reverted and asked for changes as needed, tested by watching and eval, and discussed my ideas for solutions before committing to one. I did not write any code directly, but watched what Claude was doing to check it. I had it set to ask for approval before committing anything, and that worked especially during testing and understanding what code was being changed. Planning mode helped a lot, and I was able to go through each step slowly to understand what's going on. However, Claude has started to run more complicated commands I don't understand in order to read my older code and test. It might get too fast for me to understand whats going on most of the time. The code has gotten quite complicated as well.
